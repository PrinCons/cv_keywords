    ## **Who We Are**
    
    The Farmer’s Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. We’re starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers’ doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.
    
    To date, The Farmer’s Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.

    ## **Where You'll Come In**
    
    This role is intended to further extend The Farmer’s Dog ability to make data informed decisions about the workforce and business by owning various analytical and administrative aspects of our employee listening strategy, analytical reporting, ad hoc requests, and upskilling the actionability of People Analytics products.  This role will take advantage of our newly implemented HRIS system to transform how People Analytics shares data with the organization.
    
    **One Team:** We don’t think of ourselves as “Acquisition Marketers”, “Engineers”, “Data Analysts”, or “Product Managers”. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don’t think departments matter. We’d rather align ourselves to the goals we’re working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER – getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.
    
    **We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:**  Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren’t tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there’s a better or more impactful way to solve problems.
    
    **We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:**  We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.  We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.  We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.  We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.
    
    **We Execute For Impact:** We don’t subscribe to “best practices” or “industry KPIs”. We’re uninterested in how we compare to “benchmarks”; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don’t subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles – i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.
    
    **We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption**: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, “what’s the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?”. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don’t expect to be perfect the first time.
    
    ## **How You'll Make An Impact**
    
    - Design and execute comprehensive workforce analytics initiatives covering various topics including employee experience, attrition, org design, talent acquisition, diversity, equity & inclusion (DEI) and many others.
    - Establish best practices for data collection, cleaning, and storage to ensure data integrity and accessibility
    - Create and maintain interactive dashboards and self-service reporting tools to democratize access to workforce insights
    - Develop, maintain, and administer employee lifecycle surveys including design, administration, and analysis.
    - Collaborate with HR Operations, Talent Acquisition, and HR Business Partners to optimize data collection and reporting processes
    - Drive continuous improvement in people analytics capabilities and methodologies
    - Support ad-hoc analytics requests from internal clients including HR leaders and departmental heads
    
    ## **We're Excited About You Because**
    
    - 2+ years of analytics experience preferably in People Analytics
    - You have expertise working in 1 or more programming languages such as SQL, R and RMarkdowns (tidyverse, ggplot)

    - Foundational knowledge of HR practices across areas such as talent management, talent acquisition, and HR Operations so that you can effectively translate workforce data into meaningful insights across the business

    - You are able to explain complex topics to non-technical audiences
    - You can work in a fast paced environment with shifting priorities

    ## **Office Guidelines**
    
    The office is open and available for all Monday through Friday. We ask all team members to be in office a minimum of 2-3 days a week to build a collaborative and invested environment to foster our unique in-person culture we are proud to have. This office policy is subject to change at company discretion.
    
    ## **Our DEI Philosophy:**
    
    Our company’s mission is rooted in deep, genuine care for dogs – and for the people who love them. As an organization we are full of individuals who are unique in many ways, but all united in a mission of providing true peace of mind to dog lovers everywhere. Fixing this industry and improving the lives of pets and their people will be a difficult, decades-long endeavor. We believe the best use of our time, energy, and resources as a collective team is to focus on this mission, and on supporting our team to do their best work and be their best selves. In support of this we’re committed to hiring and supporting a diverse workforce, and investing in internal structures, opportunities, hiring/promotions processes, and training that create and sustain an inclusive team. We strive to provide an experience at TFD that will be invested, meaningful and memorable as we progress on the journey to reimagine how we feed and care for our pets.
