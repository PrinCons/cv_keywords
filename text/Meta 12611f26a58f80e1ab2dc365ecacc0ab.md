- Job Description
    
    Meta's AR/VR division is developing future products in augmented reality and virtual reality. Our work in conversational AI, computer vision, advanced optics, eye tracking, machine learning & reasoning will enable and empower consumers and businesses in new ways.
    
    As a Linguistic Engineer (LE), you will focus on helping deliver datasets, models, and knowledge that power the ML systems across all components in the voice assistant product, such as ASR/TTS, NLU, NLG, Dialog, Reasoning, and the Knowledge Graph.  The Linguistic Engineer delivers datasets, consistent models and representations across languages and areas, as well as data infrastructure that powers the voice assistant product.  
    
    The ideal candidate has strong technical, analytical, and collaboration skills with experience in building datasets for ML applications.  Experience as an ML practitioner is useful but not required as the role focuses on the datasets and provides an opportunity to interface and work directly with ML teams as part of the greater voice assistant organization.  
    
    Experience with data tools, pipelines, and analytics is needed for this role.  The ideal candidate will have an interest in NLP and/or conversational AI systems and being at the cutting edge of their development.  A plus is experience in any subfield of computational linguistics, though that is not specifically a requirement for the role.
