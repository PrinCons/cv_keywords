    At Warner Music Group, we’re a global collective of music makers and music lovers, tech innovators and inspired entrepreneurs, game-changing creatives and passionate team members. Here, we know that each talent makes our collective bolder and brighter. We are guided by four core principles that underpin everything we do across all our diverse businesses:
    
    - Music is Everything: Music is our passion, and we can never get enough. Tastes, trends, and tech will change, but great artists and songwriters will always be our driving force.
    - Global Growth, Local Expertise: Music is a global language. Through communication and collaboration, our success can come from anywhere and translate everywhere.
    - Innovation and Insight: Pushing the boundaries requires the best information and the boldest imagination. We use both to create the future.
    - Empowered by People: Like the artists we serve and the music they make, our differences make us stronger. This is a place where every talent can belong and build a career.
    
    We remain committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We know it fosters a culture where you can truly belong, contribute, and grow. We encourage applications from people of any age, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, ethnicity, disability, veteran status, and any other characteristic or identity.
    
    Consider a career at WMG and get the best of both worlds – an innovative global music company that retains the creative spirit of a nimble independent.
    
    A little bit about our team:
    
    WMG’s Business Intelligence team (BI) works to influence WMG’s strategy and day-to-day operations by developing thoughtful insights & intelligence from its core business practices. The BI team works with various departments across Warner Music’s Central Functions, Recorded Music, & Music Publishing Divisions to understand the trends and dynamics that drive the constant evolution of our business. Our goal for this role is to strengthen our analytical power and bring improved rigor to the insights we deliver to our family of labels and operators. We work with partners across the company to establish best practices for breaking artists and sustaining catalog repertoire across consumption platforms, gauge the impact of marketing initiatives and campaigns, and work to understand user behavior around the world.
    
    Your role:
    
    Intelligence is the lifeblood of today’s music business, and in this role you’ll get a chance to apply your creativity and problem-solving skills to help our labels and artists connect with consumers across an array of media and mediums. Because the BI team works closely with departments across the company, you will have the opportunity to see the inner workings and decision-making within a global music company - and the ability to influence those decisions with thoughtful intelligence work. We’re a collaborative team that loves learning new things, sharing ideas, thinking about the future of the music industry – and helping our company get there.
    
    Here you’ll get to:
    
    - Lead data science projects from inception to completion on topics such as consumption and revenue forecasts, digital advertising forecasts, global trends analysis, business performance trends, and more.
    - Apply advanced data analysis and statistical modeling techniques to address complex business challenges. Develop and maintain production-level models, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
    - Work closely with Business Intelligence, Strategy, Corporate Finance, and operators to understand business needs, and provide actionable insights to a diverse audience across the business.
    - Proactively identify areas where data science can add value by experimenting with different hypotheses and techniques to improve existing processes and techniques within the BI team.
    - Utilize advanced tools and frameworks for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
    - Promote and participate in a culture of continuous learning within the team by providing feedback, sharing knowledge, and mentoring more junior team members.
    
    About you:
    
    - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, or a related field.
    - 1-3 years of full-time post-graduation experience in the music, entertainment, sports, or financial services industry. Candidates with a PhD can be considered for this level.
    - Experience and comfort in working with data from globally-trusted third-party sources like the UN, IMF, OECD, and World Bank.
    - Demonstrated ability to lead and execute data science projects with minimal supervision.
    - Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R for data analysis and model development.
    - Experience with machine learning frameworks and statistical tools.
    - Strong understanding of SQL and working with large datasets.
    - Familiarity with data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
    - Expertise in fundamental data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling techniques.
    - Ability to quickly learn and adapt to new techniques and technologies.
    - Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
    - Strong problem-solving abilities, with a bias towards action and a proactive approach to identifying opportunities and challenges.
    
    We’d love it if you also had:
    
    - Familiarity with the streaming music landscape or other digital media
    - Experience building analytical products and dashboards within BI software like Tableau or other environments like Streamlit.
