    ### About Us:
    
    We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
    
    We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
    
    Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
    
    ### About The Role:
    
    Notionâ€™s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notionâ€™s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science teamâ€™s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.
    
    As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
    
    ### What You'll Achieve:
    
    - You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
    - You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
    - You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
    - You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
    - You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
    - You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
    
    ### Skills You'll Need to Bring:
    
    - You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
    - You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
    - You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
    - You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
    - You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
    - You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
    
    We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If youâ€™re excited about a role but your past experience doesnâ€™t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If youâ€™re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
